    "\n",
    "Producing a baseline model is crucial for evaluating your model's performance on any machine learning problem. A baseline model is a basic solution that serves as a point of reference for comparing other models to. The baseline model's performance gives us an indication of how much better our models can perform relative to a naive approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are building a sentence similarity model where our training set contains pairs of sentences and we want to predict how similiar these sentences are on a scale from 1-5. We could spend months producing a complex machine learning solution to this problem and ultimately get a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.3. But is this result good or bad? There is no way of knowing without comparing it with some baseline performance. For our baseline model, we could predict the mean sentence similarity of sentence pairs in our training set (called the _zero rule_) and get a MSE of 0.35. So our model is worse than the baseline which indicates that we may want to consider using different features, models, evaluation metrics, etc. It is crucial that the choice of baseline model be tailored to a data science problem based on buisness goals and the specific modeling task."

    "Word2vec is a predictive model for learning word embeddings from text (see [original research paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf)). Word embeddings are learned such that words that share common contexts in the corpus will be close together in the vector space. There are two different model architectures that can be used to produce word2vec embeddings: continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) or continuous skip-gram. The former uses a window of surrounding words (the \"context\") to predict the current word and the latter uses the current word to predict the surrounding context words. See this [tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/word-embedding-word2vec.html#3) on word2vec for more detailed information about the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we use pretrained word2vec word embeddings. These embeddings were trained on a Google News corpus and provide 300-dimensional embeddings (vectors) for 3 million English words. See this [link](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) for the original location of the embeddings and see the code below to load these word embeddings."

The weight \"increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus\" ([tutorial link](http://www.tfidf.com/)). When we're averaging together many different word vectors to get a sentence embedding, it makes sense to give stronger weights to words that are more distinct relative to the corpus and that have a high frequency in the sentence. The TF-IDF weights capture this intution, with the weight increasing as term frequency increases and/or as the inverse document frequency increases.\n",

    "GloVe is an unsupervised algorithm for obtaining word embeddings created by the Stanford NLP group (see [original research paper](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf)) Training occurs on word-word co-occurrence statistics with the objective of learning word embeddings such that the dot product of two words' embeddings is equal to the words' probability of co-occurrence. See this [tutorial](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) on GloVe for more detailed background on the model. For our purposes, we use pretrained GloVe word embeddings (glove.840B.300d.zip which can be found through the above link). These embeddings were trained on Common Crawl data and provide 300-dimensional embeddings (vectors) for 2.2 million English words. Below is the code to load in the GloVe embeddings."

    "fastText is an unsupervised algorithm created by Facebook Research for efficiently learning word embeddings (see [original research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04606.pdf)). fastText is significantly different than word2vec or GloVe in that these two algorithms we saw earlier treat each word as the smallest possible unit to find an embedding for. Conversely, fastText assumes that words are formed by an n-gram of characters (i.e. 2-grams of the word \"language\" would be {la, an, ng, gu, ua, ag, ge}). The embedding for a word is then composed of the sum of these character n-grams. This has advantages when finding word embeddings for rare words and words not present in the dictionary, as these words can still be broken down into character n-grams. Typically, for smaller datasets, fastText performs better than word2vec or GloVe. See this [tutorial](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/unsupervised-tutorial.html) on fastText for more detail. We will use the pretrained word embeddings for the English language (wiki.en.bin; these embeddings as well as embeddings for 156 other languages can be found [here](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html)). These are 300-dimensional embeddings (vectors) trained on Wikipedia data."
